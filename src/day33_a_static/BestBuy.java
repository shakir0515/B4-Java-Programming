/**
 * static
 *      - all objects share/have the ONE/SAME copy
 *      - if it changes/updated, all objects are affected
 *      - We use class name to reach the static members
 *          - Possible to used the object reference as well but not good approach
 *      - Static ONLY accepts static members
 *      - we cannot use 'this' keyword
 *
 *
 * instance
 *      - every object has its OWN copy
 *      - if instance for one object is changed/updated, it only affects that object
 *      - We use object reference to reach instance members
 *          - NOT possible to use the Class Name to reach the instance members
 *      - Instance accepts BOTH static and instance members
