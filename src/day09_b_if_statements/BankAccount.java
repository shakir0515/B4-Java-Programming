    Create a double value for the account balance. // 100
    Create a double value for how much you want to withdraw // 500

    Check the balance after the withdrawal
        if you tried to withdraw more money than you had in the account add a negative overdraft fee to the balance: -100

    In both cases print the remaining balance after withdrawing, with overdraft free applied if you went over
